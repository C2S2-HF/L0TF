## Description

The goal of this repository is to share softare and R scripts of our paper *$\ell_0$ Trend Filtering*. Our motivation is to present our code and results in a reproducible way and facilitate the coding effort of thos who want to run further experiments or improve our model.

## Repository Structure

#### __code__ folder contains the following files in R language:
* SimuL0TF.Rmd: generate Figures 2-7 and include some more illustrative simulated examples.
* AlgoAnalysis.Rmd: replicate the reuslts and generate Figures 8-11 in Section 4.1.
* utils.R and amiasutils.R: source codes used in AlgoAnalysis.Rmd.
* RealData.R: replicate the results and generate all the graphs in Section 4.3.
* AlgoAnalysis_APP.Rmd: replicate the reuslts and generate Figures B.1-B.7 in Appendix B.1.
* __simu__ folder contains R scripts used in Appendix B.2: 
    * replicate the results in Appendix B.2 except for the l0-MIP.
    * nsimul0tfc.R and tsimul0tfc.R: replicate the results of the l0-MIP method in Appendix B.2.
* __simu_plots__ folder contains the R Scripts used to generate Figures B.9-B.20 in Appendix B.2.
    * post_plot.R: generate Figures B.9, B.11 and B.13. 
    * pre_plot.R: generate Figures B.10, B.12 and B.14.
    * post_tplot.R: generate Figures B.15, B.17 and B.19. 
    * pre_tplot.R: generate Figures B.16, B.18 and B.20. 
    * combine_RData.R: combine the RData and needed to be run before generating all the figures.


#### __figs__ folder contains all the figures in our paper (including the figures in the Appendix), which were generated by running the R code in the __code__ folder.


#### __data__ folder contains the data in the real data application in Section 4.2. Please see [spreadsheet file](data/air_hourly.csv) to view the data.

#### AMIAS_1.0.3.tar.gz contains the source file of the R package for implementing the AMIAS algorithm proposed in our paper. After downloading it, you need to run the following code in R to install it.

    install.packages("Your_download_path/AMIAS_1.0.3.tar.gz", repos = NULL)
