## Description

The goal of this repository is to share softare and R scripts of our paper *$\ell_0$ Trend Filtering*. Our motivation is to present our code and results in a reproducible way and facilitate the coding effort of thos who want to run further experiments or improve our model.

## Repository Structure

#### __code__ folder contains the following files in R language:
* SimuL0TF.Rmd: generate Figures 1-6 and include some more illustrative simulated examples.
* AlgoAnalysis.Rmd: generate Figures 7-14 in Section 4.1.
* utils.R and amiasutils.R: source codes used in AlgoAnalysis.Rmd.
* simulations.R: replicate the results in Section 4.2 except for the l0-MIP.
* nsimul0tfc.R and tsimul0tfc.R: replicate the results of l0-MIP in Section 4.2.
* RealData.R: replicate the results and generate all the graphs in Section 4.3.

#### __figs__ folder contains all the figures in our paper (including the figures in the Appendix), which were generated by running the R code in the __code__ folder.


#### __data__ folder contains the data in the real data application in Section 4.2. Please see [spreadsheet file](data/air_hourly.csv) to view the data.

#### AMIAS_1.0.3.tar.gz contains the source file of the R package for implementing the AMIAS algorithm proposed in our paper. After downloading it, you need to run the following code in R to install it.

install.packages("Your_download_path/AMIAS_1.0.3.tar.gz", repos = NULL)
